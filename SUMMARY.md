# Summary of the CircuitElement Rotation Implementation

## Problem Approach

The task was to enhance the `CircuitElement` class in a TypeScript-based project to include rotation functionality for circuit elements and their associated nodes. The goal was to allow the circuit elements to be rotated by a specified degree, ensuring that both the graphical representation and the underlying node positions are updated accordingly.

## Steps Taken to Solve the Problem

1. **Understanding the Existing Codebase**:
    - Reviewed the `CircuitElement` class and its methods.
    - Analyzed how elements and nodes are drawn, moved, and transformed.

2. **Designing the Rotation Feature**:
    - Decided to implement a `rotate` method in the `CircuitElement` class.
    - Planned to update node positions using trigonometric calculations based on the rotation angle.

3. **Implementing the Rotation Method**:
    - Added the `rotate` method to apply rotation transformations to the SVG elements.
    - Calculated the center of rotation based on the current position of the element.
    - Implemented the `updateNodePositions` method to update node coordinates using the rotation matrix formula.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Ensured the rotation applied correctly to both the visual elements and their nodes.
    - Verified that the drag-and-drop functionality and other interactions still worked as expected after rotation.

## New Packages/Technologies Used

No new packages or technologies were introduced in this implementation. The existing framework and libraries used in the project were sufficient to implement the required functionality.

## Files Heavily Changed

1. **`CircuitElement.ts`**:
    - Added `rotate` and `updateNodePositions` methods.
    - Made minor adjustments to existing methods to ensure compatibility with the new rotation functionality.
